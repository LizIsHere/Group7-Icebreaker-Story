I thought it would be another typical day where I would drive my Porsche around town, but little did I know that would not be the case.
While I was driving down the Haupstrasse, a Hund jumped in front of me, and I barely managed to slam my brakes in time to avoid him.
Thankfully I always keep brots in the glove compartment, so after I put my Porsche in park, I stepped out to reward  him for being a good boy but to also remind him that roads are no place for hunds. 
Now, it is time to head into Berlin. Here, I stopped at the local hot spot for some delicous bratwurst.
After savoring the delicious Bratwurst, I decided to explore the historic Schloss nearby, admiring its magnificent architecture and rich history.
